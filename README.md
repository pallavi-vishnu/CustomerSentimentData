-ID
-Customer Name
-Sentiment
-CSAT Score
-Call Timestamp
-Reason

This dataset sample is downloaded from https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.exceldemy.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F12%2FCall-Center-Sentiment-Sample-Data.xlsx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK
In this project, I have tried to answer the following questions:

* Which day of the week has the most calls from customers?
* Has any customer called more than once?
* What is the most common sentiment of the callers?
* What is the common reason for calls?
* Which channel is used most often?
